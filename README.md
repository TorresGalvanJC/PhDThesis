# Codes employed during the PhD project

In this repository is possible to find the codes employed during the PhD process. Not all correspond to the codes employed in the paper, that is in the "Best results" folder, but others like the way we augmented the images, the generation of the confusion amtrix performance, and the creation of the ROC curve, are used.
